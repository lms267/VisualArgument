Pre-Final Draft:
I intend for this visual argument to fully encompass the feeling of burnout, specifically student burnout. I intend for it to be purposefully 
overstimulating, and for there to be a lot going on. There will be many different stickers that help to capture the feelings associated with
overstimulation and burnout. I am hoping to not only call attention to the issue, but to help some people realize they are suffering, and 
hopefully help them get the help that they need. Burnout is a widly misunderstood issue, and I am hoping to normalize it. There need to be 
more resources available for students who are experiencing burnout. 
Post-Final Draft:
I went through several different versions of this project as I tried to figure out what procrastination looked and felt like to me. I
thought of core adjectives and images that I associate with it, and I came up with anger, frustration, time-crunch, tears, and the feeling of
drowning. Thus, this is the feeling that I tried to visualize in this argument. I chose a basic image of a stressed out student and then
worked around that. All the images and distortion in the backround are meant to symbolize how the feeling of being overwhelmed with all your
responsibilities is so vast, and seems to fill whatever space you are in, making it impossible to focus. Thus further snowballs the feeling
of being incredibly stressed out. 
Thank you, and I hope you enjoy and feel seen! You can do this!
