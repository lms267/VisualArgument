I intend for this visual argument to fully encompass the feeling of burnout, specifically student burnout. I intend for it to be purposefully 
overstimulating, and for there to be a lot going on. There will be many different stickers that help to capture the feelings associated with
overstimulation and burnout. I am hoping to not only call attention to the issue, but to help some people realize they are suffering, and hopefully 
help them get the help that they need. Burnout is a widly misunderstood issue, and I am hoping to normalize it. There need to be more resources available
for students who are experiencing burnout.
