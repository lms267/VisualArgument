I chose to make my Visual argument overstimulating visually to reflect the feeling of overstimulation that is felt
with procrastination. Therefore, I used a variety of CRAP methods. I used repition and alignment most notably. For
repitition, I repeated several of the images and stickers that I placed around the main backing image, and for 
alignment, I chose to align the weights with the outline of the student's body to represent the weight of their 
responsibilities. I am very happy with the way it turned out, and it was a very fun and cathartic process for me. It
was also reassuring to hear in my feedback that the message was well-received, and everyone immediately understood
what I was getting at.
